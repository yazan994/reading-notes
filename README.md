# Growth Mindset #
Growth Mindset: “In a growth mindset, people believe that their most basic abilities can be developed through dedication and hard work brains and talent are just the starting point. This view creates a love of learning and a resilience that is essential for great accomplishment.
## What does it mean to have a growth mindset? ##
When someone has a growth mindset they believe that they can continue to learn and become more intelligent with effort.  In contrast, someone who has a fixed mindset believes that they are born with a certain amount of talent and intelligence and that cannot be improved no matter how much effort they put forth.

# And there is three way to keep your self in a growth mindset #
1. **Acknowledge and embrace imperfections.**
Hiding from your weaknesses means you’ll never overcome them.

2. **View challenges as opportunities.**
Having a growth mindset means relishing opportunities for self-improvement. Learn more about how to fail well.

3. **Try different learning tactics.**
There’s no one-size-fits-all model for learning. What works for one person may not work for you. Learn about learning strategies.
