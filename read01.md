# Master Markdown #
## Markdown ##  
*Is a fantastic language for quickly putting together a blog post or some content for a website. Personally I use it a lot. In fact, I used it to write this article.
The main drawback of Markdown is that you are confined to a fairly limited subset of what is available in HTML. Most notably, you cannot define the majority of element attributes 
in Markdown alone. That said, Markdown wasn’t designed to be a replacement for HTML. It aims to make it simpler for web writers to create content. A goal that I think it
achieves very well. The ability to mix-in HTML also allows you to circumvent the issue of being occasionally limited by the native Markdown syntax.*

**Markdown** *is Futureproof By “futureproof,” we mean that Markdown is a plain text format. For as long as plain text is the standard (which it will be for a long, long time), 
Markdown will be usable and openable by modern programs. Compare this to Microsoft Word, which has 8 different filetypes as of 2018. Keeping things plain text ensures there will
never be an outdated version, so software doesn’t need to update to keep up with the
format.*
