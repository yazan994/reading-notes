# Wireframe
I’ve split this article into three sections. First of all, there’s a general introduction to wireframes and the tools used to create them.

## 1. What is a wireframe, and why do UX designers use them?
Wireframing is a practice used by UX designers which allows them to define and plan the information hierarchy of their design for a website, app, or product. 

When designing for the screen you need to know where all the information is going to go in plain black and white diagrams before building anything with code. Wireframing is also a great way of getting to know how a user interacts with your interface, through the positioning of buttons and menus on the diagrams.
That said, for complete beginners, bear in mind the following when deciding on your wireframe creation process:

Wireframes drawn with paper and a pencil, or at a whiteboard, have the advantage of looking and being very easy to change, which can help tremendously in early conversations about your website or product.
With the help of paper-prototypes, you can test with end users at every stage of ideation and design. Changes at these stages are much easier—and therefore cheaper—than changes deemed necessary after coding is under way.
Switching later to software (after initially hand-drawing your wireframe) allows you to keep track of more detailed decisions.

### In the bullet points below are a number of ways different designers can structure the process from design to implementation:-
- Wireframe > Interactive Prototype > Visual > Design
- Sketch > Code
- Sketch > Wireframe > Hi-Def Wireframe > Visual > Code
- Sketch > Wireframe > Visual > Code
# How to make your wireframe in six steps :- 
1. Do your research
2. Prepare your research for quick reference
3. Make sure you have your user flow mapped out

 4. Draft, don’t draw. Sketch, don’t illustrate
 5. Add some detail and get testing
 6. Start turning your wireframes into prototypes

 ## How to make your Wireframe Good: 3 Key Principles:-
 * Clarity 
 * Confidence
 * Simplicity is key.

 # HTML basics
 ## So what is HTML?
*HTML is a markup language that defines the structure of your content. HTML consists of a series of elements, which you use to enclose, or wrap, different parts of the content to make it appear a certain way, or act a certain way.*
## Anatomy of an HTML element :

1. The opening tag: This consists of the name of the element (in this case, p), wrapped in opening and closing angle brackets. This states where the element begins or starts to take effect — in this case where the paragraph begins.

2. The closing tag: This is the same as the opening tag, except that it includes a forward slash before the element name. This states where the element ends — in this case where the paragraph ends. Failing to add a closing tag is one of the standard beginner errors and can lead to strange results.

3. The content: This is the content of the element, which in this case, is just text.

4. The element: The opening tag, the closing tag, and the content together comprise the element.
Marking up text
This section will cover some of the essential HTML elements you'll use for marking up the text.
